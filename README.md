### Technical test - ContentSquare
* ContentSquare is building an automatic lawn mower designed to mow rectangular surfaces.
* (The mower can be programmed to mow the entire surface.)
The position of the mower can be represented by coordinates (x,y) and by a letter giving the cardinal direction (N,E,W,S). The lawn is divided into a grid to simplify the navigation.
* For example, a mower position can be « 0, 0, N », it means that this mower is located at the lower-left corner of the lawn, and it is oriented North.
* The mower is controlled by sending it a sequence of letters. Possible letters are « R », « L » and « F ». « R » and « L » make the mower rotate of 90° respectively to the left or to the right, without moving. « F » means that the mower is moving forward on the cell in front of it, without changing its orientation.
* If the position after the move is outside the lawn, then the mower do not move, it keeps its orientation and process the next command.
* The cell directly at North of the position (x, y) has for coordinates (x, y+1).

* An input file following these rules is given to program the mower:
* The first line is the coordinates of the upper-right corner of the lawn, coordinates of
lower-left corner are supposed to be (0,0)
* Next lines of the file drive all mowers. There are two lines for each mower:
  * First line give the initial position and orientation of the mower. Position and orientation are given by 2 numbers and a letter, separated by a space
  * Second line is a sequence of instruction driving the mower across the lawn. Instructions are a sequence of letters without space.

* Each mower moves sequentially, it means that the second mower moves only after the first one execute all its instructions.

* When the mower has executed all its instructions, it outputs its position and orientation.

### GOAL
Design and write a program implementing the above specifications and validating the following test.
### TEST
This file is given in input: 
```
5 5
1 2 N
LFLFLFLFF
3 3 E
FFRFFRFRRF
```
This output is expected (final positions of mowers): 
```
1 3 N
5 1 E
```


### Execution
* to run the program use the command:
```python main.py ```
* to run tests use the command:
``` python mower_test.py ```
